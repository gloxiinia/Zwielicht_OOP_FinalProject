text@"You know, when I said "feel free to visit me whenever", I didn't mean it literally."@2,28,31
option@"C'mon, you should know me better by now, El."@-1,0,1,-1@3
text@You hear him scoff. After a few more seconds of scribbling and a final flourish of@4 
text@his signature, he sets down his pen and finally graces you with his full attention.@5
text@"So, what is it you're in need of this time?"@6,24
option@"Can't a friend just visit for the sake of it? I thought you'd be bored, cooped \nup all day in this stuffy office."@7 
text@"Yes, while I appreciate the sentiment, might I remind you this "stuffy" office@8
text@has a nice garden, for when I need a break."@9
text@"You actually take breaks now?" You raise an eyebrow, incredulous.@10
text@El fiddles with his cuff-links, something to focus on other than your expectant gaze.@11
text@When he eventually replies, his eyes are just the slightest bit downcast and his eyebrows pinched.\n@12
text@"Not as often as I'd want, no."@13
text@"I see," is all you can reply with.@14
text@As if sensing the awkward silence left from that topic of conversation, Edelmar tries for another angle.@15
text@"Huginn's awfully quiet today, isn't he?"@16,21
option@"I told him to behave, lest we start another apocalypse."@0,0,1,1@17,21
text@He hums thoughtfully, running his ungloved hand across the fur of the great wolf beside him.@18
text@After some brief, conspiratorial whispers between the pair, he breaks into a quiet laugh.@19
text@"How very kind of you, if only it was to save your own hide," he says with a quirk of his lips.@20
text@"So, any other reason for this visit?"@25
option@"Quiet? For you, maybe. Inside my head are a million thoughts and phrases he just wants to let loose."@0,0,1,-1@22
text@You wouldn't call the expression that flits El's face concern, it's more of pity. Of what, you don't really know.@23
text@He schools his expression back to his usual level of glacial and asks:@20
option@"If anything, I think you're the one in need of this information."@0,0,0,0@25
text@"Sibyl found it."@26
text@"You jest."@27
text@"I wouldn't. Not about this, anyway."@-1
option@"Yes, I know, but this matter seemed important enough."@0,0,0,0@29
text@He sets down his pen and faces you, hands steepled.@30
text@"So, what's this "important" matter you speak of?"@25
option@"Obviously you didn't mean that literally."@0,0,0,0@32
text@"Yes, well if it was so obvious, why do you insist on barging in while I'm clearly working?"@33
text@He's still going through the documents piled high on the edge of his desk, not looking up.@34 
text@There's a certain rhythmic, machine-like quality to how he reads, signs, and stores them.@35
text@Skim, sign, store. Rinse and repeat. Sometimes, like an off-beat note, you can see the rhythym falter.@40
text@Upon further inspection, the cracks show clearer.@37
text@His hands tremble with every stroke of ink on paper.@38
text@Dark circles under his eyes concealed hastily with makeup. Each breath seems shallow and weighty.@39
text@Like someone pulling an all-nighter to catch up with a morning deadline.@40
text@But, as entrancing as the paperwork is, you don't really want to linger here.@41
text@Probably better to get this done and over with ASAP.@42,44
option@"I have information on *that* case you asked Sibyl to look into."@25 
option@"Honestly, why can't you loosen up a little sometimes?"@25
option@"Actually, I think you'd be better off asking Sibyl on this. I have better things to do."@25
