You're slightly baffled with the amount of frankly, lethal weapons on display here. On 
the other hand, considering who owns this place, it's not that shocking anymore. Front 
and center, there lies the famed Gleipnir. Said to have chained Fenrir until the end of 
the Gods. (Edelmar says it stays displayed as a reminder for everyone working here).

Other than the two Huginn's pointed out, you can see even more intriguing death-dealing
instruments. Beside the morning star, there's an oddly curved blade that's knife-sized. 
(That one's a Kukri, ever heard of it?) Up above (HOW DID YOU NOT SEE THIS IMMEDIATELY?), 
a mounted scythe, with an expertly carved handle that looked painstaking to create.
