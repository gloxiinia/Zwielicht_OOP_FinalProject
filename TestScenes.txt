West Hallway
0
4,5,7,1
The west hallway of the estate. The tiles are practically seared into my brain
with how many times you've had to come to *his* office.
EXAMINE
To the north are the restrooms. To the south... someone's office. To the east 
is back to the central hall, and west is.. well. Edelmar's office.

Edelmar's Office
1
2,3,0,-1
The office/second home of Edelmar Voigt. It's cozy, large enough to be a studio apartment.
At the very least, the place is warm and inviting, even if its owner isn't always so. You 
can see an exit out *north* towards a private garden. To the south, there's a library. (It's
supposed to be secret, but I personally think Edelmar's tired of people sneaking in when he's
not here.)

EXAMINE
There are *display cases* filled with various weapons you do not know the names of.
(That one's called a morning star, that funky looking one's a sword catcher. Guess
what it does!) To the corner, you see a *fluffy mat and bed*. Fenrir sits on it, content,
awaiting the occasional pet from his contractee.

Edelmar's Private Garden

Edel's private (debatable) garden. He grows some interesting things here. You think
I saw orchids blooming next to an actual corpse flower.

EXAMINE
The only exit here is back into Edel's office.

Edelmar's Private, Very Sh-Sh, Library
3
1,-1,-1,-1
A pretty modest library, for someone who owns a literal manor. It's got around 3 rows of bookshelves, 
ranging from entomology to microbiology.

EXAMINE
The only exit here is back into the office.
END
West Restrooms

-1,0,-1,-1
The west restrooms. What more is there to say?

EXAMINE
Only exit's back into the hallway.
END
Someone's Office

0,-1,-1,-1
It's an office, for someone you don't know... Maybe you shouldn't be in here.
(Never stopped you before though)

EXAMINE
There's noone here. Exit goes back to the hallway.
END
Public Library

-1,7,-1,-1
The estate's pride and joy. Housing seemingly all printed media ever made. It's no
wonder there's always someone coming and going from here.

EXAMINE
There's an exit back into the hallway.
END
Central Hall
7
6,8,9,0
The central hall. Not unlike a sort of hub for the other employees.

EXAMINE
You can head into the west hallway or east hallway. To the south is the dining hall
and to the north is the public library. 
END
Dining Hall

7,-1,-1,-1
Communal dining hall. There's the smell of something spicy.

EXAMINE
You can head back into the hallway by going north.
END
East Hallway

-1,-1,-1,7
The east hallway. If you'd followed the path, you'd end up in the east wing.

EXAMINE
You can head east to the central hall.
