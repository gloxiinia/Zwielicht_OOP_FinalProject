West Hallway

-1,-1,-1,1
The west hallway of the estate. The tiles are practically seared into my brain
with how many times you've had to come to *his* office.
EXAMINE
To the north are the restrooms. To the south... someone's office. To the east 
is back to the central hall, and west is.. well. Edelmar's office.

Edelmar's Office

A balcony connected to the office. You can see the city skyline from out here.
EXAMINE
Calm, no winds right now. There's a broken pot near the railing.

Edelmar's Private Garden

Edel's private (debatable) garden. He grows some interesting things here. I think
I saw orchids blooming next to an actual corpse flower.
EXAMINE
The only exit here is back into Edel's office.

Edelmar's Private, Very Sh-Sh, Library

A pretty modest library, for someone who owns a literal manor. It's got around 3 rows of bookshelves, 
ranging from entomology to microbiology.

The only exit here is back into the office.
