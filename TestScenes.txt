West Hallway
0
-1,-1,-1,1
The west hallway of the estate. The tiles are practically seared into my brain
with how many times you've had to come to *his* office.
EXAMINE
To the north are the restrooms. To the south... someone's office. To the east 
is back to the central hall, and west is.. well. Edelmar's office.

Edelmar's Office
1
2,3,0,-1
The office/second home of Edelmar Voigt. It's cozy, large enough to be a studio apartment.
At the very least, the place is warm and inviting, even if its owner isn't always so. You 
can see an exit out *north* towards a private garden. To the south, there's a library. (It's
supposed to be secret, but I personally think Edelmar's tired of people sneaking in when he's
not here.)

EXAMINE
There are *display cases* filled with various weapons you do not know the names of.
(That one's called a morning star, that funky looking one's a sword catcher. Guess
what it does!) To the corner, you see a *fluffy mat and bed*. Fenrir sits on it, content,
awaiting the occasional pet from his contractee.

Edelmar's Private Garden

Edel's private (debatable) garden. He grows some interesting things here. You think
I saw orchids blooming next to an actual corpse flower.

EXAMINE
The only exit here is back into Edel's office.

Edelmar's Private, Very Sh-Sh, Library

1,-1,-1,-1
A pretty modest library, for someone who owns a literal manor. It's got around 3 rows of bookshelves, 
ranging from entomology to microbiology.
EXAMINE
The only exit here is back into the office.
