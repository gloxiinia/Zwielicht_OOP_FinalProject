Heir to the Voigt family. He's been part of this organization for around
8 years. Quite a while, compared to you. Promoted to overseer of this
branch 3 years ago. With glares people say is as frigid as Fimbulvetr,
he's difficult to approach, let alone make conversation with. 
Right now, he just looks tired.

"Honestly, you are in a conversation, please focus."@"Really now, you're leaving in the middle of a conversation?"@"Put that back, stop acting like a child."@"Pick that back up, quickly."
Upon closer inspection, the cracks in the glass show clearer. 

His hands tremble with every stroke of ink on paper. Dark circles under his eyes 
concealed hastily with makeup. Each breath seems shallow and weighty. Like someone pulling an 
all-nighter to catch up with a morning deadline.
